# syntax error
print (we are learning python)

# runtime error
print (25/0)        # means there is error in your math

# symantic error
name="Junaid"
print ("Hello name")
# this type of error is very difficult to catch
# it is human based error
# here the python shall print Hello name
# whereas we need it to print Hello Junaid

print ("Hello", name)
print ("Hello" + name)


# troubleshooting is easy :)
