# we can use def function to define our own functions
# but there are numerous programmers who have already made libraries of code


# for example
# if you want to print the value of pi

import math         
# math is tha name of the already defined function library
#math.pi or math.acos is method to recall a function from library
print ("The value of pi is", math.pi)


x=[150,250,350,450]             
# lets say we have this array

import statistics           
# another library of statistical functions

print(statistics.mean(x))
# this is convinient way of getting mean of an array
# using already defined function


# Some important libraries are
# numpy, pandas
